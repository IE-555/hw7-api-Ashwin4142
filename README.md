## Introduction
*The purpose of this project is to visualise the standings of Barclays Premier league*
- *The type of data that is being imported is a ranking system of a football league which follows round robin procedure to decide the final winners* 
- *Data used for this projected is from the website - https://www.api-football.com/ and the API used comes from rapid API - https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-football?endpoint=apiendpoint_c8a3886a-cfdb-403f-a6ba-b5a3e84cfbb7*  

- *The data that is being used for this project was last updated on 23rd March 2020 and once, the Corona pandemic is over and the league restarts it will be updated every two footballing weeks*

## Sources
- The source code came from [the magic source code farm](http://www.amagicalnonexistentplace.com)
- The code retrieves data from [the organization for hosting cool data](http://www.anothermagicalnonexistentplace.com)

## Explanation of the Code
*In this section you should provide a more detailed explanation of what, exactly, the above code actually does.  Your classmates should be able to read your explanation and understand what is happening in the code.*

The code, `needs_a_good_name.py`, begins by importing necessary Python packages:
```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

- *NOTE:  If a package does not come pre-installed with Anaconda, you'll need to provide instructions for installing that package here.*

We then import data from [insert name of data source].  We print the data to allow us to verify what we've imported:
```
x = [1, 3, 4, 7]
y = [2, 5, 1, 6]

for i in range(0,len(x)):
	print "x[%d] = %f" % (i, x[i])		
```
- *NOTE 1:  This sample code doesn't actually import anything.  You'll need your code to grab live data from an online source.*  
- *NOTE 2:  You will probably also need to clean/filter/re-structure the raw data.  Be sure to include that step.*

Finally, we visualize the data.  We save our plot as a `.png` image:
```
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.savefig('samplefigure.png')	
plt.show()
```

The output from this code is shown below:

## How to Run the Code
*Provide step-by-step instructions for running the code.  For example, I like to run code from the terminal:*
1. Open a terminal window.

2. Change directories to where `needs_a_good_name.py` is saved.

3. Type the following command:
	```
	python needs_a_good_name.py
	```

- *NOTE: You are welcome to provide instructions using Anaconda or IPython.*

## Suggestions
*Finally, you should suggest any additional features that would be useful/interesting.  For example, what else could you do with these data?  How might you want to modify the plot to be more descriptive?  What summary statistics might you want to calculate with these data?*
